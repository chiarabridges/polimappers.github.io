          <p class="text-justify">PoliMappers is a student association of Politecnico di Milano, recently founded in December 2016. The mission of the group is to do mapping across different realities within the university as well as among primary and secondary schools, furthermore to train and motivate the next generation of volunteer mappers.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">PoliMappers is the first European chapter of the International Association YouthMappers, founded in 2014 in the United States of America with the support of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to cultivate a new generation of leaders in the field of open geospatial data and technologies, with the purpose of creating through them resilient communities of the future. YouthMappers is a global network that currently includes some 52 chapters in 18 countries. In accordance with the terms of participation of YouthMappers, the association's activities include at least two mapping activities per year: mapping the local
area and participating in a YouthMappers network promoted campaign.</p>
